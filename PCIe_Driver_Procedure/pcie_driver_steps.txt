PCIe driver steps: -
========================

Once the driver knows about a PCI device and takes ownership, the driver generally needs
to perform the following initialization:

	- Enable the device
	- Request MMIO/IOP resources
	- Set the DMA mask size (for both coherent and streaming DMA)
	- Allocate and initialize shared control data (pci_allocate_coherent())
	- Access device configuration space	
	- Register IRQ handler (request_irq())
	- Initialize non-PCI (i.e. LAN/SCSI/etc parts of the chip)
	- Enable DMA/processing engines

When done using the device, and perhaps the module needs to be unloaded, the driver needs
to take the follow steps:

	- Disable the device from generating IRQs
	- Release the IRQ (free_irq())
	- Stop all DMA activity
	- Release DMA buffers (both streaming and coherent)
	- Unregister from other subsystems (e.g. scsi or netdev)
	- Release MMIO/IOP resources
	- Disable the device

Most of these topics are covered in the following sections. For the rest look at LDD3 or <linux/pci.h>.
